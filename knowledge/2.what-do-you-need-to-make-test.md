# What Do We Need to Run Tests?

To effectively implement and run tests in a software development project, several key components are required. These components work together to create a robust testing environment that helps ensure the reliability and quality of your software.

## Testing Library

-   **Description:** A testing library provides a set of tools and functions specifically designed for creating and managing test cases. It allows developers to write test scripts that can automate the testing of various parts of the application.
-   **Example:** Jest is a popular testing library that is often used for testing JavaScript applications. It offers features like test organization, mocking, and assertions, making it a comprehensive choice for both unit and integration testing.

## Assertion Library

-   **Description:** An assertion library is used within test cases to check if the application behaves as expected under certain conditions. It allows for the validation of test outcomes by comparing the actual output of your code against expected values.
-   **Clarification:** It's worth noting that many modern testing libraries, including Jest, come with their own assertion capabilities built-in. Therefore, a separate assertion library might not be necessary if your chosen testing framework already provides these functionalities.

## Test Runner

-   **Description:** A test runner is a tool that automates the execution of your test scripts, displaying the results of the tests. It manages the lifecycle of tests, including initialization, execution, and teardown, and provides feedback on the success or failure of each test case.
-   **Example:** While some testing libraries (like Jest) include their own test runner, the term can also refer to external tools or scripts that facilitate running tests from the command line or through a CI/CD pipeline. For example, the `npm run test` command in a Node.js project typically triggers the execution of tests using the project's configured test runner.


## Mocks, Spies, and Stubs

In software testing, **Mocks**, **Spies**, and **Stubs** are types of test doubles â€“ objects, functions, or modules that replace real implementations for testing purposes. Each serves a different purpose in a testing environment, helping to isolate the system under test and simulate various scenarios and behaviors.

### Mocks

-   **Description:** Mock objects are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways. A mock object replaces a real object in a testing environment, returning predetermined responses to function calls.
-   **Purpose:**
    -   To test the interactions between the system under test and its dependencies.
    -   To verify that certain methods are called, with expected arguments, and a specified number of times.
-   **Usage:** Mocks are particularly useful in unit testing when the actual objects are impractical to incorporate into tests due to reasons such as network dependency, slow response, or unpredictability.

### Spies

-   **Description:** Spy objects are used to gather information about function calls. They can wrap existing functions and record information such as how many times a function was called, what arguments were passed to it, and what the return value was.
-   **Purpose:**
    -   To verify that functions are called correctly without necessarily interfering with their execution.
    -   Spies can be used to "spy on" real implementations, adding a layer of observation to real function calls.
-   **Usage:** Spies are useful for integration testing where the actual implementation of a function is used, but the interaction with it needs to be tested and verified.

### Stubs

-   **Description:** Stubs are simplistic implementations that replace functions. Unlike mocks, they do not necessarily mimic the exact behavior of the real object but provide a fixed response to calls.
-   **Purpose:**
    -   To control the behavior of a function to ensure the component under test behaves as expected under various conditions.
    -   Stubs can return hardcoded values, throw errors, or perform simple calculations.
-   **Usage:** Stubs are ideal when the test needs to bypass actual execution of a function that is irrelevant to the test scenario, such as network requests, file system access, or complex calculations.

### Key Differences and When to Use

-   **Mocks** are best when you need to verify the behavior of the system under test, including how it uses its dependencies.
-   **Spies** are ideal for when you want to perform assertions on a function that is actually executed, without altering its output.
-   **Stubs** are suitable for providing predetermined responses to function calls, especially when testing the system under test's reaction to different inputs or states of its dependencies.


## Code Coverage
Code coverage is a metric used to measure the extent to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite runs. It provides an important indicator of software quality and test completeness. Code coverage helps in identifying untested parts of a codebase, ensuring that the tests cover as broad a spectrum of scenarios as possible.

### Key Aspects of Code Coverage

-   **Purpose:** The primary purpose of code coverage is to gauge the effectiveness of your test cases. It helps in identifying code segments that are not covered by any test cases, guiding developers on where additional tests may be needed.
-   **Types of Coverage:** There are several types of code coverage metrics, including:
    -   **Statement Coverage:** Measures the percentage of executable statements in the code that are executed during testing.
    -   **Branch Coverage (Decision Coverage):** Measures the coverage of all the possible branches (if-else decisions) in the code.
    -   **Function Coverage:** Tracks the functions or methods that have been called during the execution of tests.
    -   **Line Coverage:** Similar to statement coverage but measures the number of lines executed during testing.
    -   **Condition Coverage:** Ensures that all the boolean sub-expressions have been evaluated to both true and false.
